#HelloWorld
Now that everything is installed, you're ready to take the dive!

##The First App
Your first task is to create the app pictured below.

###Whoa! What's going on man?
First off, we have 2 text labels and 2 buttons on the screen. Both labels have a black background and white text color, while both buttons simply have a default skin.

###But what's the challenge?
Going from top to bottom, the first label and the first button are built using the `interface builder`. The second button and the second label are built `programmatically`. Clicking the first button will set the first label to "Hello, iPhone" and clicking the second button will increment the click count starting from 0. You will do this by creating a Single View Application for iPhone using MonoDevelop.

###So, what's the point of all this?
Well, you learned...
* How to create apps with MonoTouch.
* How to use the interface builder.
* How to wire up controls.
* How to create controls programmatically in C#.
