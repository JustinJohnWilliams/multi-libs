* Install XCode4 via the AppStore or from [Apple Developer Central](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action).

If you have a Mac install XCode4 along with the XCode4 command line tools
(via the AppStore...if you dont have LionOS, the previous version of XCode should work fine),
you'll also want to install MonoTouch http://xamarin.com/monotouch (this is
a licensed product with a 30 day trial, so be sure to install it closer to the
event). Download NodeJS for Mac from here: http://nodejs.org/download/ and use
